Project 9
Name: Chengyue Lin

I made a Plane Battle Game. And it is using the direction keys to manipulate the plane. And use "space" key to fire. If you want to quit the game,
you can press "q" to quit the game. And when you beat all of two enemy planes, you will win the game. The enemy planes will automatic moving from right 
to left and left to right. Nothing to do when two planes collision. 


One bug that I can't fix is when we firing, all the planes include enemy planes can't moving until the bullet go to the top of screen or beat the 
enemy plane. If I don't do a while loop for firing bullet, we can't actually see the bullet from my plane move up. Thus, I just keep the thing like 
that. 

And I get reference from the website: https://github.com/ErikUmble/JackBitmapEditor  . It helps me to draw my plane and enemy plane. It is from the 
nand2tetris.org webiste of project 9. I got it from there.
